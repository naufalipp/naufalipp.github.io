        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: June 10, 2025</p>

        <h2>Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h2>
        <p>Your privacy is our highest priority. LogMyDay: Timesheet Journal is designed to be a completely private and secure space for you. Our core principle is simple: <strong>we do not collect, store, or process any of your personal data.</strong></p>
        <p>Everything you create within the app stays on your device.</p>

        <h2>1. No Data Collection</h2>
        <p>LogMyDay: Timesheet Journal does not collect any personal information or data from you. We do not require you to create an account, and we have no access to your:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Timesheet entries</li>
            <li>Journal entries</li>
            <li>Project names, task descriptions, or billing rates</li>
            <li>Photos or any other content you add to the app</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Local Data Storage</h2>
        <p>All data you create in LogMyDay: Timesheet Journal, including all your timesheet and journal entries, is stored exclusively in a secure, local database on your own device. This data is not transmitted to us or any third party. You are in complete control of your information.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Export</h2>
        <p>The app provides a feature to export your data as a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file. This process is initiated entirely by you. When you choose to export your data, the file is saved directly to your device's local storage. The app does not automatically transmit this file anywhere; you have sole control over what you do with the exported file.</p>

        <h2>4. App Permissions</h2>
        <p>To allow you to save your exported CSV file, the app may request permission to access your device's storage. This permission is used <strong>only</strong> for the purpose of saving the exported file to the location you choose on your device. The app does not access, read, or modify any other files in your storage.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>The security of your data is in your hands. Since all your information is stored locally on your device, we strongly recommend you use the built-in security features of your device, such as setting a strong passcode, PIN, or using biometric authentication (fingerprint or face ID), to protect access to your device and the information stored within it.</p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>We do not knowingly collect any personal information because the app does not collect any data at all. This app can be used by anyone, but we encourage parents and guardians to observe, participate in, and/or monitor and guide their children's online activity.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect any changes in our app's functionality, though our core commitment to not collecting your data will remain. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the app.</p>

        <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us at: <a href="mailto:naufal211@gmail.com">naufal211@gmail.com</a></p>
